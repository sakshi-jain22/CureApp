***************************MVC********************************

Model -> effects the storage
View -> handles User Interface. it can not directly interact with the model
Route -> helps in interaction between view and controller
Controller -> consists of business logic (components and interfaces), controller interacts with the model

# one controller can also have multiple views.
# A client is only concerned about the view, they don't know what's happening behind the scene. They will only get a page as per the request made.
# HTML only provides a static web page whereas JSP provides dynamic web page.


***************************AngularJS****************************
